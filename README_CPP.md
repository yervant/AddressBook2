AddressBook2
=====

A command line application developed in C++ programming language.
The main purpose of this project is to act as a qualification test of
mastering of C++.


# Note!!! (For submit your code)

 * Fork me and use pull request to submit changes to `develop` branch. Anything unclear about the feature, fire issue on github.
 * You should submit your source code and Makefile
 * Remember this is the only place to submit your code, not by email. Tip: do some basic learning of github


# Requirement

Browse and modify a JSON data structure with `ls`,`cd`,`cat`, `add`, `remove`

## Must be implemented features

* Let's say we have this address entry data structure in JSON

        {
            "entries": {
                "lilei" : {
                    "age": 27,
                    "mobile" : "13700000000",
                    "address" : "Earth somewhere"
                }, 
                "hanmeimei" : {
                    "age": 26,
                    "mobile" : "13700000001",
                    "address" : "Earth somewhere else"
                }
            }
        }

* start interactive command line application

    `sh> ./ab`

    `ab> _`
    
* use `ls` command to list the items in current position
    
    `ab> ls`

    `ab> entries`

* use `cd` command to go to the entry like go to a directory
    
    `ab> cd entries`

    `ab> ls`
    
    `ab> lilei hanmeimei`

* use `cat` command to display th item data
    
    `ab> cat lilei`

    `ab> "lilei" : { "age": 27, "mobile" : "13700000000", "address" : "Earth somewhere" }`

        
* use `add` command to add new address entry to JSON

    `ab> cd entries`

    `ab> add`

    `key: xiaoming`

    `value: { "age": 28, "mobile" : "13700000002", "address" : "Earth somewhere too" }`

    `address entry added`

    `ab> ls`
    
    `ab> lilei hanmeimei xiaoming`
    
    Note: the key should be identical, if trying to add duplicated key, just display an error message 

* use `remove` command to get one or more address entries
    
    `ab> cd entries`

    `ab> remove`

    `please give the key: xiaoming`
    
    `xiaoming was deleted from JSON`

    Note: if trying to delete an non-exist key, just display an error message 

* get help

    `ab> !help`

    then help message should be displayed, and when encoutering invalid command, help message
    should also be displayed.

* quit from the application

    `ab> !quit`

    `sh> _`

 
## Nonfunctional requirement
 
* your programme should be object-orinted
 
* your code should be well-formatted
  * __NEVER__ use `tab` for indentation
 
* comments for public interface/class/method is a must
 
* please use linked list to store data in memory, when exit the application, you should persist the data to file system. 
 * when application start if you can reload the persistent file is a plus.
 
* please use simple key/value as persistent file format 

* a big plus if you can implement an address book server within the application(telnet or raw socket protocol). when you start interactive command line application, first it starts a socket server, then takes interactive commands as the input for your socket client.
 
* gcc or g++ should be should be used to compile and generate runable application. If you working on windows, you can use Cygwin.
 
* please provide your steps to build this application 
  * Make file is a plus.
 
* __DO NOT__ store any IDE specific files into git repository
 
* if there is any fault in this readme, please also fix it or submit an issue
